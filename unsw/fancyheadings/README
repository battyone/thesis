There is a new version of this package, called "fancyhdr" in
tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyhdr. 
It has an easier user interface for complicated cases, but it is 99%
compatible with fancyheadings. It works with both LaTeX2e (the real LaTeX)
and LaTeX 2.09 (the obsolete version). I advise you to use fancyhdr,
unless this would give you serious problems (in which case I would like to
know what the problems are).
